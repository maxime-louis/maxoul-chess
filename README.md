This is a simple implementation of a chess engine:
- min max search
- alpha-beta pruning
- quiescence search to sort captures
- iterative deepening with aspiration window to speed up the process
- evaluation function with material and piece position tables.

From the 'bot' object, it's straightforward to create a lichess-bot (code omitted).
